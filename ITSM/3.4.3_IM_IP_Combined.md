| **P1 (Critical)** | Business-critical outage or major incident causing total loss of service. Requires immediate attention 24/7. | - Entire website down<br>- Payment system unavailable<br>- Database corruption blocking all users                     | **Incident Response Team**, Senior Engineers, SysAdmins, Managers (all hands on deck) | - **MTTD**: Detect as fast as possible (seconds/minutes)<br>- **MTTA**: Acknowledge instantly<br>- **MTTR**: Drive down to minimum to restore service<br>- **MTBF**: Improve reliability to reduce recurrence |
| **P2 (High)**     | Major function severely degraded, but workarounds exist. High impact to many users.                          | - Email service slow or partially down<br>- Regional outage<br>- High latency across services                         | **On-call Engineers**, escalated to Seniors if unresolved quickly                     | - **MTTD**: Rapid monitoring alerts<br>- **MTTA**: On-call acknowledges promptly<br>- **MTTR**: Hours, not days<br>- **MTBF**: Track recurring failures in specific components                                |
| **P3 (Medium)**   | Non-critical issue affecting some users, does not block core business.                                       | - Reporting tool not generating reports<br>- Single microservice failing<br>- Performance issue for a subset of users | **Support Team**, Developers, SysAdmins (business hours)                              | - **MTTA**: May allow longer acknowledgment<br>- **MTTR**: Resolved in business hours or next sprint<br>- **MTTF/MTBF**: Used to assess system reliability trends                                             |
| **P4 (Low)**      | Minor issue, enhancement, or informational request. Little/no business impact.                               | - Cosmetic UI bug<br>- Documentation correction<br>- Feature request                                                  | **Support Desk**, Junior Engineers, Developers (normal backlog cycle)                 | - Metrics less urgent, but **MTBF** and **MTTF** help plan long-term maintenance<br>- **MTTR** less critical, may be days/weeks                                                                               |
