Here‚Äôs a solid training module on **Linux file permissions**, `chmod`, `chown`, and `sudo`, with explanations and examples.

## Linux File Permissions and User Management

In Linux, every file and directory has permissions that control who can read, write, or execute them. System administrators also use commands like `chmod`, `chown`, and `sudo` to manage access and privileges.

---

### 1. Understanding File Permissions

When you run `ls -l`, you‚Äôll see something like this:

```
-rw-r--r--  1 student student  1200 Sep 30 07:55 notes.txt
```

Breakdown:

* `-rw-r--r--` ‚Üí permission string
* First character (`-`) ‚Üí file type (`-` = regular file, `d` = directory)
* Next 9 characters ‚Üí permissions in groups of three:

| Group | Meaning              | Example            |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| `rw-` | Owner can read/write | user permissions   |
| `r--` | Group can read only  | group permissions  |
| `r--` | Others can read only | others permissions |

* **r = read**, **w = write**, **x = execute**

---

### 2. Changing Permissions with `chmod`

The `chmod` command modifies file or directory permissions.

#### Symbolic Mode

* **Usage:**

  ```
  chmod u+x script.sh   # add execute for user (owner)
  chmod g-w file.txt    # remove write from group
  chmod o+r file.txt    # add read for others
  ```
* **Shortcuts:**

  * `u` = user (owner)
  * `g` = group
  * `o` = others
  * `a` = all

#### Numeric (Octal) Mode

Permissions can also be set with numbers:

* Read = 4, Write = 2, Execute = 1
* Add values for each group.

Example:

```
chmod 755 script.sh
```

* `7` ‚Üí owner = read+write+execute (4+2+1)
* `5` ‚Üí group = read+execute (4+1)
* `5` ‚Üí others = read+execute (4+1)

---

### 3. Changing Ownership with `chown`

The `chown` command changes file ownership.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  chown user:group filename
  ```
* **Examples:**

  ```
  chown alice file.txt        # change owner to alice
  chown alice:developers file.txt  # change owner and group
  sudo chown root:root /etc/config # requires admin rights
  ```

---

### 4. Running Commands as Another User with `sudo`

The `sudo` command lets authorized users run commands with **superuser (root)** privileges.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  sudo command
  ```

* **Examples:**

  ```
  sudo apt update        # run system update
  sudo chown root file   # change ownership to root
  sudo nano /etc/hosts   # edit system file
  ```

* **Switching Users:**

  ```
  sudo su -          # switch to root user
  sudo -u alice bash # run a shell as user alice
  ```

---

## Quick Practice

1. View permissions of all files in your current directory.

   ```
   ls -l
   ```

2. Make a script executable by the owner.

   ```
   chmod u+x script.sh
   ```

3. Set a file to be readable/writable by the owner, readable by group, and no access for others.

   ```
   chmod 640 file.txt
   ```

4. Change ownership of `project.txt` to user `bob`.

   ```
   sudo chown bob project.txt
   ```

5. Run a command as root to view system logs.

   ```
   sudo less /var/log/syslog
   ```

---

**Key Takeaway:**

* **Permissions (`rwx`)** define file access for user, group, and others.
* **`chmod`** changes permissions.
* **`chown`** changes file ownership.
* **`sudo`** lets you run commands with elevated privileges.

# Practice

Perfect üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **practice exercise set with answers** for Linux file permissions, `chmod`, `chown`, and `sudo`.

## Practice Exercises: File Permissions, chmod, chown, and sudo

Use these exercises to test your understanding of Linux permissions and privilege management.

---

### Exercise 1: Viewing Permissions

1. List all files in the current directory with their permissions.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   ls -l
   ```

2. What does the following mean?

   ```
   -rwxr-x---
   ```

   **Answer:**

   * Owner: read, write, execute
   * Group: read, execute
   * Others: no permissions

---

### Exercise 2: Changing Permissions with `chmod`

1. Give the owner execute permission on `script.sh`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   chmod u+x script.sh
   ```

2. Remove write permission for the group on `file.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   chmod g-w file.txt
   ```

3. Set permissions of `report.txt` to **rw-r-----** using numeric mode.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   chmod 640 report.txt
   ```

---

### Exercise 3: Changing Ownership with `chown`

1. Change ownership of `data.csv` to user `alice`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   sudo chown alice data.csv
   ```

2. Change both owner and group of `app.log` to `bob:developers`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   sudo chown bob:developers app.log
   ```

---

### Exercise 4: Using `sudo`

1. Run the `apt update` command with administrator privileges.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Edit the system hosts file `/etc/hosts` with nano.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/hosts
   ```

3. Switch to the root user.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   sudo su -
   ```

---

### Challenge: Combined Task

1. Create a script file named `backup.sh`.
2. Give it read, write, and execute permissions for the owner only.
3. Change the owner to `root`.
4. Run the script with superuser privileges.

**Answer:**

```
touch backup.sh
chmod 700 backup.sh
sudo chown root backup.sh
sudo ./backup.sh
```

---

## Key Reinforcement

* Use `ls -l` to inspect permissions.
* Use `chmod` to modify permissions (symbolic or numeric).
* Use `chown` to change file ownership.
* Use `sudo` to run commands as root or another user.


Absolutely! Including a diagram or cheat sheet with the numeric values and common `chmod` combinations would make it much easier for learners to quickly grasp file permissions. You could, for example, show a table like this:

**Numeric values for permissions:**

| Permission  | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Read (r)    | 4     |
| Write (w)   | 2     |
| Execute (x) | 1     |

**Common `chmod` combinations:**

| Mode | Meaning                                                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 644  | Owner: read/write, Group: read, Others: read                         |
| 755  | Owner: read/write/execute, Group: read/execute, Others: read/execute |
| 700  | Owner: read/write/execute, Group: none, Others: none                 |
