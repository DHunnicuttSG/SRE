In networking and Linux context, **P1 to P4** usually refer to **incident priority levels** (sometimes called severity levels) — often used in ITIL, DevOps, and sysadmin environments. These define **how urgent an issue is**, **its impact**, and **who should respond**.

Here’s a table with **definitions, examples, and who helps** for each level:

# Incident Priority Levels (P1–P4)

| Priority          | Definition                                                                                                          | Example                                                                                                                                                         | Who Helps / Response Team                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P1 (Critical)** | A **business-critical outage** or major incident causing total loss of service. Requires immediate attention, 24/7. | - Entire website or application is down<br>- Payment system unavailable<br>- Database corruption stopping all transactions                                      | **Incident Response Team**, Senior Engineers, System Admins, Network Engineers, and Managers (all hands on deck). |
| **P2 (High)**     | A **major function is severely degraded**, but some workarounds may exist. High impact on many users.               | - Email service slow or partially down<br>- High latency affecting multiple services<br>- One region of cloud environment offline                               | **On-call Engineers** (SysAdmins/Developers), possibly escalated to Senior Engineers if unresolved quickly.       |
| **P3 (Medium)**   | A **non-critical issue** that affects some users but does not block core business functions.                        | - A reporting tool not generating data correctly<br>- Single microservice failing, but core system works<br>- Performance degradation for small subset of users | **Support Team**, Developers, SysAdmins (handled in business hours).                                              |
| **P4 (Low)**      | A **minor issue, enhancement, or informational request**. Little to no impact on business operations.               | - Cosmetic UI bug<br>- Documentation correction<br>- Feature request                                                                                            | **Support Desk**, Junior Engineers, Developers (handled via normal backlog/maintenance cycle).                    |
