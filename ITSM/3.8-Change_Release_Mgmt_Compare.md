# **Change Management vs Release Management**

| Aspect             | **Change Management (Change Enablement in ITIL 4)**                                                                                                | **Release Management**                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**        | Control the lifecycle of changes to minimize risk and disruption.                                                                                  | Plan, schedule, and deploy releases into the live environment.                                                                                                |
| **Focus**          | **Approval & risk management** – making sure a change is safe and justified.                                                                       | **Delivery & deployment** – making sure the change is packaged, tested, and delivered correctly.                                                              |
| **Scope**          | All types of changes (infrastructure, application, process, configuration).                                                                        | Specifically about delivering new or updated **software, features, or services**.                                                                             |
| **Timeframe**      | Decision-making and planning before implementation.                                                                                                | Execution and rollout of the change into production.                                                                                                          |
| **Key Activities** | - Logging RFCs (Requests for Change) <br> - Assessing risk & impact <br> - Approval (CAB or automated) <br> - Scheduling <br> - Post-change review | - Building and packaging releases <br> - Testing and validation <br> - Coordinating rollout <br> - Ensuring successful deployment <br> - Post-release support |
| **Outputs**        | Approved, scheduled, and documented changes.                                                                                                       | Successfully deployed release packages in the live environment.                                                                                               |
| **Ownership**      | Change Manager (facilitates the process, ensures governance).                                                                                      | Release Manager (coordinates development, testing, and deployment teams).                                                                                     |
| **Example**        | Decision to upgrade a database server → CAB approves after risk assessment.                                                                        | Deploying the new database software patch and updating live servers.                                                                                          |

# **How They Work Together**

* **Change Management** ensures that a **change request** is properly assessed, approved, and scheduled.
* **Release Management** ensures that the **approved change** is **built, tested, and deployed** smoothly.
* Example:

  * Change Management approves a new payroll system upgrade.
  * Release Management packages, tests, and deploys the new software into production.

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**

* **Change Management = Should we do it? How? When?** (decision, risk, approval)
* **Release Management = How do we deliver it successfully?** (build, test, deploy)
