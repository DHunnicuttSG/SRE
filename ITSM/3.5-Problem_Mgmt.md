# **What is Problem Management?**

ðŸ‘‰ **Problem Management** is the ITIL practice focused on **identifying and managing the root causes of incidents** to prevent recurrence and reduce impact.

* **Incident Management** = fix **symptoms** quickly (get the service running again).
* **Problem Management** = fix the **cause** (prevent it from happening again).

---

# **Operational Processes of Problem Management**

### **1. Problem Detection**

* Problems can be detected in different ways:

  * Analysis of recurring incidents.
  * Automated monitoring alerts (e.g., frequent disk failures).
  * Supplier or vendor advisories (e.g., bug in an OS patch).
* **Goal:** Spot underlying issues that need investigation.

---

### **2. Problem Logging**

* Every problem is formally **recorded** in the problem management system.
* Information captured:

  * Problem description
  * Related incidents
  * Affected services
  * Business impact
* **Goal:** Ensure tracking and accountability.

---

### **3. Problem Categorization & Prioritization**

* Problems are classified by category (hardware, software, network, security, etc.).
* Prioritization considers:

  * **Impact** (business disruption caused).
  * **Urgency** (how quickly it must be resolved).
* **Goal:** Ensure resources are focused on the most damaging problems.

---

### **4. Problem Investigation & Diagnosis**

* Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is performed using techniques like:

  * **5 Whys**
  * **Ishikawa (Fishbone) diagrams**
  * **Fault Tree Analysis**
* **Goal:** Identify the underlying cause and possible workarounds.

---

### **5. Workaround Development**

* If the permanent solution is not immediately available, a **workaround** is created.
* Workarounds reduce the impact of incidents linked to the problem.
* Documented in the **Known Error Database (KEDB)**.

---

### **6. Problem Resolution**

* Permanent fixes are designed, tested, and implemented (often via **Change Enablement**).
* Example: Upgrading faulty hardware, applying patches, redesigning a process.
* **Goal:** Eliminate the root cause.

---

### **7. Problem Closure**

* Problem record is formally closed once:

  * Root cause is resolved.
  * Solution is verified.
  * Documentation and knowledge base are updated.
* **Goal:** Ensure transparency and learning for future prevention.

---

# **The Value of Problem Management**

Problem Management delivers **strategic and operational value**:

### **1. Reduced Incident Volume**

* Fewer repeat incidents because root causes are eliminated.
* Service desk load decreases, freeing up resources.

### **2. Faster Incident Resolution**

* Workarounds stored in the **KEDB** give the service desk quick fixes.

### **3. Improved Service Quality**

* More stable IT environment, fewer outages, better user satisfaction.

### **4. Cost Reduction**

* Less downtime = reduced business disruption.
* Fewer firefighting activities = more focus on innovation.

### **5. Better Risk Management**

* Early identification of underlying issues prevents major outages.

### **6. Knowledge Sharing**

* Documented RCA, known errors, and solutions improve organizational learning.

# **Quick Summary**

* **Problem Management = root cause + prevention.**
* **Processes:** Detection â†’ Logging â†’ Categorization â†’ Prioritization â†’ Investigation â†’ Workaround â†’ Resolution â†’ Closure.
* **Value:** Reduces incidents, saves costs, improves reliability, and boosts customer confidence.
