# **Incident Management**

üëâ **Incident Management** = The practice of **restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible** and minimizing business impact after an incident (an unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of service).

---


### **1. Detection & Identification**

* **What happens:** An incident is first noticed.
* **Sources:** User reports, service desk calls, monitoring tools, automated alerts.
* **Goal:** Identify that something is wrong quickly.
* **Example:** A monitoring system detects a web server is down, or a user reports they cannot log in.

---

### **2. Logging**

* **What happens:** The incident is formally **recorded** in the incident management system (e.g., ServiceNow, JIRA Service Management).
* **Details captured:**

  * Date/time
  * User info
  * Description of issue
  * System/service affected
* **Goal:** Ensure every incident is tracked and not lost.

---

### **3. Categorization**

* **What happens:** Incident is classified by **type and category** for easier management and reporting.
* **Example categories:** Hardware, software, network, security, service request.
* **Goal:** Helps assign incidents to the right support group and track trends.

---

### **4. Prioritization**

* **What happens:** Incidents are given a **priority level** based on **impact** (how many users/business processes affected) and **urgency** (how quickly it must be resolved).
* **Example:**

  * High Priority = Banking website down (all customers impacted).
  * Low Priority = Minor UI glitch for one user.
* **Goal:** Ensure resources are focused on the most critical incidents first.

---

### **5. Initial Response**

* **What happens:** Service desk or first-line support acknowledges the incident.
* **Actions:**

  * Quick checks (‚ÄúHave you tried restarting?‚Äù).
  * Providing workarounds if available.
* **Goal:** Give users immediate feedback and possibly restore service quickly.

---

### **6. Diagnosis**

* **What happens:** Incident is investigated to find the cause.
* **Actions:**

  * Analyze logs, run diagnostics, replicate issue.
  * Check known error database for solutions.
* **Goal:** Identify resolution or temporary workaround.

---

### **7. Escalation (if needed)**

* **What happens:** If first-level support cannot resolve it:

  * **Functional Escalation:** Pass to specialist teams (network, database, dev team).
  * **Hierarchical Escalation:** Inform management for high-impact issues.
* **Goal:** Ensure incidents are handled by the right expertise and get proper attention.

---

### **8. Resolution & Recovery**

* **What happens:** The fix is applied and tested.
* **Actions:**

  * Implement permanent solution (e.g., patch, restart service, replace hardware).
  * Validate that service is back to normal.
* **Goal:** Restore service to agreed **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**.

---

### **9. Closure**

* **What happens:** The incident is formally closed in the system.
* **Actions:**

  * Confirm with the user that service is restored.
  * Document resolution details.
  * Update knowledge base if applicable.
* **Goal:** Ensure the incident is fully resolved and learnings are recorded.
