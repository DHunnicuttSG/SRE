# Incident Lifecycle Timeline (P1 Example)

Here’s the **incident lifecycle flow** in a **top-down flowchart**.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Failure Occurs] --> B[MTTD<br/>Mean Time to Detect]
    B --> C[MTTA<br/>Mean Time to Acknowledge]
    C --> D([Engineer/On-call<br>acknowledges the alert])
    D --> E[MTTR<br/>Mean Time to Resolve]
    E --> F([Team investigates -> <br/>fixes issue -> <br/>service restored])
    F --> G([Postmortem and knowledge<br/> base updated])
    G --> H[Service Normal]
    H --> I([How much time went by <br/>before a similar incident, <br/> priority level and category, <br/>has gone by **averaged**])

```

## How Metrics Fit Together

* **MTTD**: Time between the *failure happening* and the *team detecting it*.
* **MTTA**: Time between *detection/alert* and *human acknowledgment*.
* **MTTR**: Time between *acknowledgment* and *full resolution*.
* **MTBF / MTTF**: Measured separately as *reliability metrics* (time between failures).

---

✅ Example (P1 outage):

* Failure: 1:00 PM
* Detected: 1:03 PM → **MTTD = 3 min**
* Acknowledged: 1:05 PM → **MTTA = 2 min**
* Resolved: 1:35 PM → **MTTR = 30 min**
* Total duration: **35 min downtime**
