# Incident Lifecycle Timeline (P1 Example)

Perfect — here’s the **incident lifecycle flow** in a **top-down (TD) Mermaid flowchart**, with **MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR** clearly labeled.

You can copy-paste this into any Markdown or Mermaid renderer (like GitHub, GitLab, or VS Code extensions):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Failure Occurs] --> B[MTTD<br/>Mean Time to Detect]
    B --> C[MTTA<br/>Mean Time to Acknowledge]
    C --> D[MTTR<br/>Mean Time to Resolve]
    D --> E[Service Normal]

    %% Styling for emphasis
    style A fill=#ffcccc,stroke=#ff0000,stroke-width=2px
    style B fill=#fff3cd,stroke=#ffae42,stroke-width=2px
    style C fill=#cce5ff,stroke=#007bff,stroke-width=2px
    style D fill=#d4edda,stroke=#28a745,stroke-width=2px
    style E fill=#e2e3e5,stroke=#6c757d,stroke-width=1px
```

✅ This will render a **top-down flow**:

* **Red box** = Failure occurs
* **Yellow box** = MTTD
* **Blue box** = MTTA
* **Green box** = MTTR
* **Gray box** = Service normal

---

## How Metrics Fit Together

* **MTTD**: Time between the *failure happening* and the *team detecting it*.
* **MTTA**: Time between *detection/alert* and *human acknowledgment*.
* **MTTR**: Time between *acknowledgment* and *full resolution*.
* **MTBF / MTTF**: Measured separately as *reliability metrics* (time between failures).

---

✅ Example (P1 outage):

* Failure: 1:00 PM
* Detected: 1:03 PM → **MTTD = 3 min**
* Acknowledged: 1:05 PM → **MTTA = 2 min**
* Resolved: 1:35 PM → **MTTR = 30 min**
* Total duration: **35 min downtime**
