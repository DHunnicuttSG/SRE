### **Absolute Path**

An **absolute path** is like giving someone the **full address of a room in a house**, starting from the front door.

**Analogy:**

* Imagine your house has a **front door**, a **living room**, a **hallway**, and a **bedroom**.
* To tell someone exactly where the bedroom is, you give the **full directions from the front door**:

```
Front Door → Living Room → Hallway → Bedroom
```

* No matter **where the person is currently standing in the house**, they can follow these directions and always reach the bedroom.

**In Linux terms:**

* Absolute path starts from the root `/` and specifies every folder:

```bash
/home/david/Documents/Notes.txt
```

### **Relative Path**

A **relative path** is like giving directions **from wherever someone is currently standing** in the house.

**Analogy:**

* Suppose someone is already in the **living room** and you want them to go to the bedroom.
* You don’t need to start from the front door; you can just say:

```
Go through the hallway → Bedroom
```

* The directions **depend on your current location**.

**In Linux terms:**

* Relative path starts from your **current directory**:

```bash
../Hallway/Bedroom.txt
```

* `..` means "go up one level," just like walking back to a previous room before turning into another.
