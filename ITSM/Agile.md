# **Agile Methodology Overview**

Agile is a **philosophy of software development** focused on **collaboration, flexibility, and delivering value quickly**. Instead of rigid long-term planning, Agile emphasizes **short cycles of work, continuous feedback, and adapting to change**.

---

## **Agile Philosophy (The Agile Manifesto)**

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

👉 It’s not “no documentation” or “no planning” — it’s about **prioritizing people and outcomes**.

## **Key Agile Terms**

* **User Story** – A short description of a feature from the user’s perspective (“As a user, I want… so that…”).
* **Backlog** – A prioritized list of work items (features, bugs, tasks).
* **Sprint** – A short, fixed period (usually 2–4 weeks) where the team delivers a set of stories.
* **Increment** – The working product delivered at the end of each sprint.
* **Velocity** – How much work a team completes each sprint (used for planning).
* **Definition of Done (DoD)** – Agreed criteria for when work is considered complete.

## **Agile Roles / Personnel**

* **Product Owner (PO)** – Owns the product vision and backlog, prioritizes work, represents the customer.
* **Scrum Master** – Facilitator/coach; removes blockers, enforces Agile practices, protects the team.
* **Development Team** – Cross-functional group (devs, testers, designers) that builds the product.
* **Stakeholders** – Customers, users, or business leaders who provide feedback.

## **Agile Ceremonies (Scrum Example)**

1. **Sprint Planning** – Decide what will be done in the sprint.
2. **Daily Stand-up (Daily Scrum)** – Quick sync (15 minutes max).

   * Each team member answers:

     1. *What did I do yesterday?*
     2. *What will I do today?*
     3. *Are there any blockers?*
3. **Sprint Review** – Demo the product increment to stakeholders for feedback.
4. **Sprint Retrospective** – Team reflects on what went well and what to improve.

---

## **Agile Stand-up Procedure Example**

* **Time-boxed:** 15 minutes.
* **Same time, same place daily.**
* **Focus on collaboration, not problem-solving** (issues raised are addressed after the meeting).
* **Scrum Master ensures it stays on track.**

### Stand-up Meeting questions:
1. What did you get done yesterday?
2. What are you working on today?
3. What are your blockeers?

✅ **Quick Summary:**
Agile = *work in small cycles, collaborate closely, respond to change, and focus on delivering value early and often.*
