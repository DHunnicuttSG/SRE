## Linux Command Line Basics

This section covers some of the most common Linux commands that every beginner should know. You will learn how to navigate the filesystem, find information, and understand how Linux paths work.

---

### 1. `ls` – List Directory Contents

The `ls` command shows the files and folders in the current directory.

* **Basic usage:**

  ```
  ls
  ```
* **Options:**

  * `ls -l` → detailed view (permissions, owner, size, date)
  * `ls -a` → shows hidden files (those beginning with `.`)
  * `ls -lh` → human-readable sizes
  * `ls -d` → display directories inside current directory
  * `ls -ltr` → display files in a table list from oldest to newest. This command provides information about size, file permission and last modified date

---

### 2. `pwd` – Print Working Directory

This command displays your current location in the filesystem.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  pwd
  ```
* **Example output:**

  ```
  /home/student/projects
  ```

---

### 3. `cd` – Change Directory

The `cd` command moves you from one directory to another.

* **Examples:**

  ```
  cd Documents       # move into Documents
  cd ..              # move up one level
  cd /etc            # move to an absolute path
  cd ~               # move to your home directory
  ```

---

### 4. `man` – Manual Pages

Linux provides built-in manuals for most commands.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  man ls
  ```
* **Navigation:**

  * Arrow keys to scroll
  * `q` to quit

This is one of the most important commands for self-help.

---

### 5. `~` – Home Directory Shortcut

The tilde (`~`) represents your home directory.

* **Examples:**

  ```
  cd ~       # go to home
  ls ~/docs  # list files in docs folder inside home
  ```

---

### 6. `history` – Command History

Shows a list of recently used commands.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  history
  ```
* **Tip:** Use the **up/down arrow keys** to scroll through past commands.
* You can re-run a previous command with:

  ```
  !25    # runs the command at history number 25
  ```

---

### 7. `uname` – System Information

Displays basic system information.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  uname
  uname -a   # shows all details (kernel, machine type, OS)
  ```

---

### 8. Absolute vs. Relative Path Names

Linux paths can be **absolute** or **relative**.

* **Absolute path:**
  Always starts at the root (`/`) and gives the full location.

  ```
  /home/student/Documents/file.txt
  ```

* **Relative path:**
  Starts from your current directory.

  ```
  ../Documents/file.txt
  ```

Relative paths are shorter and flexible, but absolute paths are unambiguous.

---

### Quick Practice

1. Open your terminal.
2. Use `pwd` to see where you are.
3. List files with `ls -l`.
4. Move to another directory with `cd`.
5. Check system info with `uname -a`.
6. Look at your past commands with `history`.

---

**Key takeaway:** These commands form the foundation of Linux navigation and self-help. Mastering them will make you comfortable exploring and managing files from the command line.
