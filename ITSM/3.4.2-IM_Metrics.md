# Incident Management Metrics

Metrics are used in IT operations and DevOps. They help track how quickly issues are detected, responded to, and resolved.

Here’s a table with the **main metrics (MTTR, MTTD, MTBF, MTTA, etc.)**, their **meaning**, and **explanation**:

# Incident Management Metrics

| Metric                 | Full Form                     | Explanation                                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MTTD**               | Mean Time to Detect           | Average time it takes to **detect** an incident after it occurs.                                                         | If a service goes down at 1:00 PM and monitoring alerts the team at 1:05 PM → detection time = 5 minutes. |
| **MTTA**               | Mean Time to Acknowledge      | Average time it takes for the **team to acknowledge** an incident after being alerted.                                   | Monitoring tool alerts at 1:05 PM, engineer acknowledges at 1:10 PM → MTTA = 5 minutes.                   |
| **MTTR**               | Mean Time to Resolve / Repair | Average time it takes to **fully fix and restore** the service after an incident is detected.                            | Incident detected at 1:05 PM, service restored at 1:35 PM → MTTR = 30 minutes.                            |
| **MTTF**               | Mean Time to Failure          | Average time a system operates **before failing**. Used for reliability.                                                 | A disk drive runs for 3 years before failure.                                                             |
| **MTBF**               | Mean Time Between Failures    | Average time between one failure and the next. Higher MTBF = more reliable system.                                       | Server crashes once every 6 months → MTBF = 180 days.                                                     |
| **MTTD + MTTA + MTTR** | End-to-End Recovery Time      | Combined, these represent the **total time an incident lasts** (from failure → detection → acknowledgment → resolution). | Service fails at 1:00 PM, detected at 1:05, acknowledged at 1:10, resolved at 1:35 → Total = 35 minutes.  |

✅ With these metrics, teams can measure **speed of detection, responsiveness, repair time, and reliability**.
