# The `ip` Command in Linux

The `ip` command is a versatile networking tool that allows you to configure and display information about networking, routing, and interfaces. It has mostly replaced older commands like `ifconfig`, `route`, and `netstat`.

---

## General Syntax

```bash
ip [OPTIONS] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }
```

* **OBJECT**: What you want to manage (e.g., `link`, `addr`, `route`, `neigh`).
* **COMMAND**: The action (e.g., `add`, `delete`, `show`).

## Common Objects and Uses

### 1. **Interfaces (Links)**

Used to manage and display network interfaces.

```bash
ip link show                # Show all network interfaces
ip link set eth0 up         # Enable interface eth0
ip link set eth0 down       # Disable interface eth0
ip link set eth0 mtu 1400   # Set MTU size for eth0
```

---

### 2. **IP Addresses**

Assign or view IP addresses on interfaces.

```bash
ip addr show                # Show IP addresses on all interfaces
ip addr show dev eth0       # Show IPs on eth0
ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0   # Add IP address
ip addr del 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0   # Remove IP address
```

---

### 3. **Routes**

Manage the system’s routing table.

```bash
ip route show                          # Display routing table
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0   # Add route
ip route del 192.168.2.0/24            # Delete route
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1   # Set default gateway
```

---

### 4. **Neighbors (ARP Table)**

Manage ARP entries.

```bash
ip neigh show                          # Show ARP table
ip neigh add 192.168.1.20 lladdr 00:11:22:33:44:55 dev eth0
ip neigh del 192.168.1.20 dev eth0
```

---

### 5. **Monitoring**

Watch network changes in real time.

```bash
ip monitor all
```

---

## Comparison with Older Tools

* `ifconfig` → `ip addr`, `ip link`
* `route` → `ip route`
* `arp` → `ip neigh`
* `netstat -r` → `ip route show`

---

## Key Points

* The `ip` command is the **modern standard** for Linux networking.
* It is more powerful and flexible than older tools.
* Always requires root privileges for changes (`sudo`).

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Bring up interface
sudo ip link set eth0 up

# Assign IP address
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.5/24 dev eth0

# Add default route
sudo ip route add default via 10.0.0.1

# Verify
ip addr show dev eth0
ip route show
```
