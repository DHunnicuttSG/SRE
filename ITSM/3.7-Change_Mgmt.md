# **What is Change Management?**

ðŸ‘‰ Change Management is the ITIL practice that ensures **changes to IT services and infrastructure are introduced in a controlled way** â€” reducing risk, minimizing disruption, and ensuring successful implementation.

A **change** = any addition, modification, or removal of something that could affect IT services (e.g., software updates, hardware upgrades, configuration changes).

# **Change Management Processes**

### **1. Change Identification & Logging**

* A change request is raised (often called an **RFC â€“ Request for Change**).
* Sources: IT staff, business, vendors, or automation (e.g., patch release).
* Information recorded:

  * Change description
  * Reason/business case
  * Impact and risk
  * Resources required
  * Proposed schedule

---

### **2. Change Categorization**

* Changes are classified by **type and impact**:

  * **Standard Change** â†’ Low-risk, pre-approved, repeatable (e.g., password reset policy update).
  * **Normal Change** â†’ Requires assessment and approval (e.g., database upgrade).
  * **Emergency Change** â†’ Urgent, must be implemented quickly (e.g., security patch for critical vulnerability).

---

### **3. Change Assessment & Approval**

* Each change is evaluated for:

  * **Impact** (on business and IT services).
  * **Risk** (likelihood of failure, security exposure).
  * **Cost and resources**.
  * **Benefit** (value to the business).
* **CAB (Change Advisory Board):** For major changes, a group of stakeholders reviews and approves.

---

### **4. Change Planning & Scheduling**

* Approved changes are carefully **planned and scheduled** to minimize disruption.
* Includes:

  * Implementation plan
  * Test plan
  * Backout/rollback plan (in case of failure)
  * Communication plan

---

### **5. Change Implementation**

* Change is deployed according to the plan.
* Testing and validation occur before going live (if applicable).
* Emergency changes may bypass full planning but still require documentation.

---

### **6. Change Review & Closure**

* After implementation:

  * Verify whether objectives were achieved.
  * Check for unexpected side effects.
  * Document results (success/failure, lessons learned).
  * Close the change record.

---

# **The Value of Change Management**

### **1. Reduced Risk of Failure**

* Structured reviews and approvals reduce service outages caused by poorly planned changes.

### **2. Improved Business Agility**

* Well-managed changes mean faster adaptation to business needs (e.g., rolling out new apps).

### **3. Increased Success Rate**

* Standardized process ensures changes are tested, communicated, and backed by rollback plans.

### **4. Better Communication & Transparency**

* Stakeholders are informed about whatâ€™s changing, when, and why.

### **5. Compliance & Audit Readiness**

* Documentation of approvals, testing, and reviews provides an audit trail for regulators.

### **6. Optimized Resource Use**

* Prioritization ensures that effort and budget go to changes that bring the most value.

# **Quick Summary**

* **Change Management = control + risk reduction.**
* **Processes:** Identification â†’ Categorization â†’ Assessment â†’ Planning â†’ Implementation â†’ Review & Closure.
* **Value:** Ensures IT changes are **safe, efficient, aligned with business goals, and minimally disruptive**.
