**SDLC** stands for **Software Development Life Cycle**, which is a structured process to develop software efficiently, from initial concept to deployment and maintenance. It provides a roadmap to ensure quality, timely delivery, and predictable results.

## **1. What is SDLC?**

SDLC defines **phases** that software goes through during its life. Common phases include:

1. **Requirement Analysis** – Gather and document what the system must do.
2. **System Design** – Plan architecture, data models, and user interfaces.
3. **Implementation / Coding** – Developers write the actual code.
4. **Testing** – Verify that the software works as expected.
5. **Deployment** – Release the software to users.
6. **Maintenance** – Fix bugs, add enhancements, and update the system.

## **2. Waterfall Methodology**

**Waterfall** is the **traditional, linear approach** to SDLC.

### **Key Characteristics:**

* Sequential: Each phase must finish before the next starts.
* Well-documented: Requirements and designs are fixed upfront.
* Little customer interaction during development.

### **Waterfall Phases Example:**

```
Requirement -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance
```

### **Pros:**

* Easy to understand and manage.
* Works well for projects with clearly defined requirements.

### **Cons:**

* Difficult to accommodate changes once development starts.
* Late testing can lead to costly fixes.

## **3. Agile Methodology**

**Agile** is an **iterative and flexible approach** to SDLC.

### **Key Characteristics:**

* Development happens in **small increments** called **sprints** (usually 1–4 weeks).
* Frequent collaboration with stakeholders and continuous feedback.
* Testing happens **throughout the process**, not just at the end.

### **Agile Phases Example (simplified per sprint):**

```
Plan -> Design -> Develop -> Test -> Review -> Repeat
```

### **Pros:**

* Flexible and adaptable to change.
* Early delivery of working software.
* Continuous feedback improves quality.

### **Cons:**

* Requires high customer involvement.
* Harder to predict time and budget precisely.

## **4. Waterfall vs Agile – Quick Comparison**

| Aspect               | Waterfall                  | Agile                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Approach             | Sequential / Linear        | Iterative / Incremental |
| Requirements         | Fixed upfront              | Evolving, flexible      |
| Customer Involvement | Minimal during development | Continuous throughout   |
| Testing              | At the end                 | Throughout development  |
| Change Management    | Difficult                  | Easy and adaptable      |
| Documentation        | Heavy                      | Minimal / lightweight   |

---

**Summary:**

* **Waterfall** is predictable but rigid.
* **Agile** is flexible and responsive but requires more collaboration.
