## Linux File Viewing and Searching Commands

Linux provides several commands to view and search through files directly from the terminal. These are essential for working with logs, scripts, and text files.

---

### 1. `cat` – Concatenate and Display Files

The `cat` command is used to display the contents of a file, combine multiple files, or create new ones.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  cat filename
  ```
* **Examples:**

  ```
  cat notes.txt                  # show file contents
  cat file1.txt file2.txt > all.txt  # combine files into one
  ```

---

### 2. `head` – Show the Beginning of a File

The `head` command shows the first 10 lines of a file by default.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  head filename
  ```
* **Options:**

  * `head -n 20 filename` → show first 20 lines
  * `head -c 50 filename` → show first 50 characters

---

### 3. `tail` – Show the End of a File

The `tail` command shows the last 10 lines of a file by default.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  tail filename
  ```
* **Options:**

  * `tail -n 20 filename` → show last 20 lines
  * `tail -f filename` → follow a file live (useful for logs)

---

### 4. `less` and `more` – Paginated File Viewing

These commands allow you to scroll through long files one page at a time.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  less filename
  more filename
  ```
* **Navigation in `less`:**

  * `Space` → next page
  * `b` → back one page
  * `/word` → search forward
  * `q` → quit

`less` is generally more powerful than `more`, but both are useful.

---

### 5. `grep` – Search for Text

The `grep` command searches for patterns inside files and prints matching lines.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  grep "pattern" filename
  ```
* **Examples:**

  ```
  grep "error" logfile.txt          # find lines containing 'error'
  grep -i "warning" logfile.txt     # case-insensitive search
  grep -r "TODO" ~/projects         # search recursively in a directory
  grep -n "main" program.c          # show line numbers with matches
  ```

---

## Quick Practice

1. Display the contents of a file named `report.txt`.

   ```
   cat report.txt
   ```

2. Show the first 5 lines of `report.txt`.

   ```
   head -n 5 report.txt
   ```

3. Show the last 20 lines of `system.log`.

   ```
   tail -n 20 system.log
   ```

4. View `bigfile.txt` one page at a time.

   ```
   less bigfile.txt
   ```

5. Search for the word “failed” in `auth.log`.

   ```
   grep "failed" auth.log
   ```

---

**Key Takeaway:**

* Use `cat` for quick output.
* Use `head`/`tail` to peek at the beginning or end.
* Use `less`/`more` to scroll through large files.
* Use `grep` to search inside files.

# Practice

Perfect — here’s a **practice exercise set with answers** for the file viewing and searching commands (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less/more`, `grep`).

## Practice Exercises: File Viewing and Searching

These exercises will help you practice reading and searching files using common Linux commands.

---

### Exercise 1: `cat`

1. Display the contents of a file named `notes.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   cat notes.txt
   ```

2. Combine `a.txt` and `b.txt` into a new file called `combined.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   cat a.txt b.txt > combined.txt
   ```

---

### Exercise 2: `head`

1. Show the first 10 lines of `report.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   head report.txt
   ```

2. Show only the first 3 lines of `report.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   head -n 3 report.txt
   ```

---

### Exercise 3: `tail`

1. Show the last 10 lines of `system.log`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   tail system.log
   ```

2. Show the last 50 lines of `system.log`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   tail -n 50 system.log
   ```

3. Watch `system.log` in real time as it grows.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   tail -f system.log
   ```

---

### Exercise 4: `less` / `more`

1. View `bigfile.txt` one screen at a time, allowing both forward and backward navigation.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   less bigfile.txt
   ```

2. View `bigfile.txt` page by page, but only forward.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   more bigfile.txt
   ```

---

### Exercise 5: `grep`

1. Search for the word "error" in `logfile.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   grep "error" logfile.txt
   ```

2. Search for the word "warning" in `logfile.txt`, ignoring case.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   grep -i "warning" logfile.txt
   ```

3. Search recursively for the word "TODO" in all files under `~/projects`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   grep -r "TODO" ~/projects
   ```

4. Show line numbers of every line in `program.c` that contains the word "main".
   **Answer:**

   ```
   grep -n "main" program.c
   ```

---

### Challenge: Combined Practice

1. Display the first 15 lines of `auth.log`.

   ```
   head -n 15 auth.log
   ```

2. Search inside those 15 lines for the word "failed".

   ```
   head -n 15 auth.log | grep "failed"
   ```

---

## Key Reinforcement

* `cat` for quick display.
* `head` and `tail` for sampling beginning or end of files.
* `less` and `more` for scrolling large files.
* `grep` for powerful text searching.
