Perfect 👍 Let’s create a **side-by-side comparison of Problem Management vs Incident Management** so it’s crystal clear how they differ and complement each other.

# **Incident Management vs Problem Management**

| Aspect                     | **Incident Management**                                                 | **Problem Management**                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                | Restore **normal service** as quickly as possible.                      | Identify and eliminate the **root cause** of incidents.                                         |
| **Focus**                  | Short-term fix / quick resolution.                                      | Long-term prevention / permanent solution.                                                      |
| **Trigger**                | A user reports an incident, or monitoring detects an outage.            | Repeated incidents, trend analysis, or a major incident that requires root cause investigation. |
| **Goal**                   | Minimize downtime and disruption to users.                              | Prevent recurrence and reduce overall incident volume.                                          |
| **Timeframe**              | Immediate response (minutes/hours).                                     | Longer-term investigation (days/weeks).                                                         |
| **Typical Output**         | Incident ticket closed once service is restored (may use a workaround). | Root Cause Analysis (RCA), Known Error Record, permanent fix, or workaround.                    |
| **Ownership**              | Service Desk / 1st-line and 2nd-line support.                           | Problem Management team / specialists / engineering teams.                                      |
| **Knowledge Contribution** | Records incident resolution for reporting.                              | Updates Known Error Database (KEDB) and Knowledge Base with RCA and workarounds.                |
| **Example**                | A user can’t log in → reset their password and restore access.          | Multiple login failures traced back to a faulty authentication server → patch applied.          |

# **How They Work Together**

* **Incident Management** = **reactive firefighting** → get the service running again.
* **Problem Management** = **proactive root cause elimination** → stop the fire from happening again.

Together, they **balance speed and stability** in IT service management.

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**

* **Incident Management** restores service **fast**.
* **Problem Management** ensures the same issue **doesn’t happen again**.
